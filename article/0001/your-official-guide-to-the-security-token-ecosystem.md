# Your Official Guide to the Security Token Ecosystem

A new generation of tokens is upon us. If 2017 was the year of utility tokens, 2018 will undoubtedly be remembered for the birth of an entirely new eco-system of platforms, exchanges, and funds, all looking to capitalize on the trillion-dollar opportunity that is tokenized securities. Tokenization is becoming particularly popular amongst more traditional issuers and investors, allured by the benefits of blockchain technology, as well as the crypto whales, looking to hedge their increasingly volatile portfolios.

_The combination of forces has created a new frontier in financial innovation._

### **What are Security Tokens?**

Security tokens, tokenized securities or investment tokens, are financial securities compliant with SEC regulations. These Gen-2 tokens can provide an array of financial rights to an investor such as equity, dividends, profit share rights, voting rights, buy-back rights, etc. Often these tokens represent a right to an underlying asset such as a pool of real estate, cash flow, or holdings in another fund. These rights are written into a smart contract and the tokens are traded on a blockchain-powered exchange.

> Some evangelists claim that these securities will soon become so popular, traditional stock exchanges and OTC markets will be completely replaced over the next decade.

For more on types of security tokens and how they differ from utility tokens, please refer to an earlier piece [here](https://medium.com/thisisdna/a-world-where-all-tokens-are-securities-227651c4e173).

### Why tokenize?

Advantages of tokenization include fractionalization of larger assets, increased liquidity, lower issuance fees, and greater market efficiency. However, _the greatest benefit that security tokens provide an issuer is access to a global pool of capital_. As these tokens can be sold and traded internationally (when compliant with regulations), they become more fairly priced and, therefore, attractive to investors. This SEC compliant offering is appealing to both institutional investors for it’s more recognizable structure, and to crypto investors for its technological innovation.

> **New Term to Know:** _“STO” — a security token offering. Similar to ICO for utility token offerings._

### **How to tokenize?**

If you are thinking of tokenizing your next funding round, prepare yourself for a six month process of hiring advisors, lawyers, and engaging with some of the following platforms. When done correctly, your company should spend two months working with advisors and legal counsel on structuring the offering, and creating marketing materials, one month working with a technical platform to onboard your token, and three months conducting a roadshow for both traditional and crypto investors.

The following list should work as a solid starting point for figuring out what platforms and advisors to engage with, as well as blueprints from other issuances. Let’s get comfortable as we are about to go into some details.

### Liquidity Layers:

### [Bancor](https://www.bancor.network/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*dlhGmiZgVPDvquLCMklN3w.png)

Bancor offers a liquidity model that connects multiple tokens to one pool of capital, enabling price discovery and ensuring liquidity even in low transaction volume environments. In the context of securities, this model complements existing best practices and provides alternative ways to achieve liquidity, enhancing the benefits of moving securities to the blockchain. Bancor is often described as the long-tail of value creation, that is, the long tail of low demand and low volume products. In the tokenized security market, one example for this use case is found in the partnership between SPiCE VC, a tokenized VC fund and Bancor. As part of the arrangement, SPiCE VC is committed to holding up to 5% of its capital on the Bancor network, so that token holders can benefit from additional ways to liquidate their holdings.

One of the big promises of the tokenization of assets is to open the floodgates of the global pool of capital, eliminating siloed demand and supply dynamics restricted by geography and infrastructure. Airswap is a decentralized exchange that enables trading on a global scale, connecting individual entities across markets. In the context of security tokens this results in increased liquidity and a generally more stabilized, less volatile demand environment.

### [BCap (Blockchain Capital)](http://blockchain.capital/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*4-tTdo1Nlo7q-zMfPbg5bg.jpeg)

Pioneered by Brock Pierce himself, Blockchain Capital was arguably the first to introduce a public offering for a securitized token. In its ICO, Blockchain Capital hoped that it could improve the emerging token sale industry in [multiple ways](https://www.smithandcrown.com/sale/blockchain-capital/). The offering created a blueprint for future tokenized securities, invested in other ICO’s that embodied some of the best practices and accepted funds only from accredited investors. The token sale reached its hard cap of $10M within six hours. The proceeds from the offering were transferred to one of Blockchain Capital’s funds. According to the offering memorandum, the fund’s managing partners collect a 2.5% management fee and a 25% performance fee. The remainder of profits are to be distributed to token holders.

**Amount Raised:** $[10](http://www.the-blockchain.com/2017/04/11/blockchain-capital-closes-ico-10-million-in-six-hours-raised-in-record-time/)M

### [Science Blockchain](https://science.tokenhub.com/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*b3u0eb_q40Ey5lFjR_L6Pg.png)

Science Blockchain is a fund and an incubator focused on blockchain investments. Thus, it’s almost logical that the fund was raised through an Initial Coin Offering of a security token (SCI). The SCI-token provides token holders with rights to up to 70% of the stream of new tokens generated from portfolio companies. Additionally, the fund’s proceeds from liquidity events are anticipated to be used to repurchase tokens via a buyback program, thus allowing investors to enjoy equity appreciation.

**Amount Raised:** $12.3M

**Management:** Founders Peter Pham, Mike Jones and Greg Gilman, founders and investors in the original [Science incubator](https://www.science-inc.com/).

### [Lottery.com](https://tokensale.lottery.com/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*YvWcww91m0tyOtvkM1K4mw.png)

Lottery.com, formerly AutoLotto, is a mobile lottery service. The company intends to utilize blockchain technology to enhance its services through instant payouts, transparency, flexibility, and expansion across international markets. The company is nearing the close of the private sale of it’s STO, rumored to be in the nine-figure range. This securitized token produces a financial yield to token holders based on gross raffle sales. Securitize and Cashbet have partnered with Lottery.com to help bring the offering to the market.

### [SPiCE VC](https://www.spicevc.com/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*5BqRbOsP2BPzsnppqDv39A.png)

While VCs have been behind almost all the greatest disruptions of our time, the VC industry has remained almost untouched. SPiCE VC intends to change this through its tokenized VC fund model that offers almost immediate liquidity for investors. If, in traditional VC funds, LPs had to wait anywhere between 7–12 years until they gain full access to their funds, SPiCE token holders get a piece of the exit pie, while enjoying a tradable asset. Even though the company intends to invest in some utility tokens, SPiCE is focused first and foremost on security tokens, with Securitize being their first portfolio company.

**Amount Raised:** $[40M](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spice-vc#section-funding-rounds)

**Management:** Carlos Domingo, Managing Partner, Former CEO of Telefonica R&D

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*wV3U8OpCoptcMBvUFPIyfQ.jpeg)

Startup fundraising is hard. That’s why a group of entrepreneurs from a recent batch of 500 Startups, a highly selective accelerator, came together to form a new tokenized fund. 22X Fund will invest in up to 30 of the startups that graduated from the San Francisco 2017 [500 Startups](https://500.co/) batch. The fund will hold between 2.5%-10% equity in the companies it invests in. Token holders receive their returns by trading the tokens on an exchange or through a token repurchase program that applies after a portfolio company experiences a liquidity event such as an exit or an IPO.

**Amount Raised:** $[22M](https://www.22xfund.com/) to date (goal $35M)

**Notable Management and Advisors:** Jamie Finn, Porfolio Manager

Nebulous, the operating company of the Sia platform, is offering 750 Siafunds out of a total of 10,000 Siafunds, as a Reg D security token. This is an example of a [‘two-tier’ or dual tokens issuance](https://medium.com/thisisdna/a-world-where-all-tokens-are-securities-227651c4e173), which is used both a security and a utility token.

**Amount Raised:** In Progress
