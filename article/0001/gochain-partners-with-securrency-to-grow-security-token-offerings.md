# GoChain Partners with Securrency to Grow Security Token Offerings

The [**GoChain**](http://gochain.io) team is excited to announce our partnership with [**Securrency**](https://www.securrency.com/)**,** a financial tech company offering products for tokenized issuance and securities trading.

#### About Securrency

[**Securrency**](https://www.securrency.com/) is a financial services technology infrastructure and products company that delivers unique investment banking tools built around core universal identity, rights and interoperability technology. This lightweight, yet powerful, infrastructure supports Securrency’s complete suite of security and compliance products to enable the secure and compliant issuance, maintenance, and secondary trading of tokenized securities by issuers, broker-dealers, alternative trading system (ATS) operators, and exchange operators.

Securrency’s unique Compliance Aware Token™ embeds regulatory and transactional rules in a compliance layer to facilitate legally-compliant securities offerings in the United States and globally. Securrency’s protocol can be utilized on multiple distributed ledgers, as well as on legacy systems, allowing for seamless and compliant on-chain and off-chain movement of tokens.

Securrency was formed in 2015 by US national security and technology experts to enable the free trading of previously illiquid asset classes through compliance and unparalleled interoperability. Securrency offers secure, scalable FinTech/RegTech tools either as individual modules or as a customized venue for listing securities via Security Token Offerings (STOs) while providing global jurisdiction-specific compliance.

_“Securrency is by far the stand alone leader in the STO space when it comes to turn key solutions for Security Token Offerings. It’s also a big step for GoChain to open its doors to broaden its scope beyond Utility Tokens.”_

**— Jason Dekker, GoChain CEO**

#### Why GoChain?

Securrency was selected as a GoChain partner because of its unique and groundbreaking financial services infrastructure technology, which creates unifying protocols for identity, compliance and interoperability. Building on this core infrastructure, Securrency has developed the leading technology products for the issuance and trading of security tokens worldwide. These unique capabilities ensure that security tokens issued using Securrency’s technology remain compliant through both primary issuance and secondary market activity and are easily exchangeable across multiple venues.

As a result of recent guidance from the SEC and other global regulators regarding compliance standards for STOs, the rate of security token deployment has slowed as the market matures towards institutional standards. Despite these challenges, GoChain and Securrency consider 2018 to be the year of the dApp (decentralized application) and the partnership between the two companies will assist in the deployment of security tokens by expediting the technical development and regulatory compliance processes necessary to successfully execute an STO. The unique attributes of the GoChain protocol are ideally suited to support this new financial services infrastructure.

_“We love the blazing speed and the low cost of the GoChain network...By combining GoChain’s remarkably efficient network with Securrency’s unmatched ability to truly automate compliance and functionality for security tokens, new business models for security tokens open up. Most importantly, speed, efficiency, security and compliance will result in true market liquidity for security tokens, and that’s what makes Securrency’s partnership with GoChain so exciting and important.”_
